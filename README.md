# Daily-Planner

For this assignment I was to create the JavaScript for a daily planner so that I could save information to the site and that it would be responsive with time. I feel I am getting more comfortable with JavaScript but still not where I would like to be. I was not able to get the local storage to work properly so that it would save what I wrote down in the planner. I need to spend more time out of class learner as much as I can about JavaScript because I know it is vital.

I was able to get the table looking how I wanted it to which I was happy with. This task was still hard for me though, I would like to finish the next one without anything left out. The most time-consuming part of this assignment for me was figuring out how to get the time block to show correctly, I needed to use my google fu a lot. Really want to get better at understanding JavaScript though so I can do better on these assignments.
